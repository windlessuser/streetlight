Alright guys, This is the git repository we're gonna use for the project.
It may be better if we append all out programming update notes to this readme file.

NOTE: Seeing as we are speaking about our updates in this README, commit messages will have the following format:
		commit -a -m "See Update XX-XX-XXXX -My Name"

Updates:

18-03-2012 - Marc
  - Created a test.php in the root directory to test the database connection. It turns out the server is using
    a deprecated version of MySQL (version 4.1 - Oracle has stoped supporting it from 09.)
    The modern version of php in incompatible with it. 
    I recommend updated the mysql server before we proceed.

18-03-2012 - Valdeck
  created the public_request_form.php (HTML/CSS) to be prepulated and edited as necessary by the user

  	- Kadeem and I have discovered that it saves us some worries when we explicitly delcare the name of the table in our models. you do this by making
	  a static variable in the class:
	  eg. static $table_name = 'table_name';  reference: http://www.phpactiverecord.org/projects/main/wiki/Conventions
	  
	- It would be wise to take a good look at the active records wiki. I'm just truly appreciating how awesome it is.
	  lets say you want to find some in a table. You can do it like this:
	  	Table::find_by_table_attribute($variable); 
	  It will find the records(s) in the table that meet the conditions. You can also use other sql verbs in it
	  example: Table::find_by_attribute1_or_attribute2($v1,$v2); This works like your standard SQL or.
	  
	- My file public_request_xml creates an xml representation of the public_request table.
	
	-I've also made some corrections to Valdeck's files (streetlight.php, user.php). He's still getting the hang of oop.
	 The commented out lines are his while the line underneath is my correction.

       - Please use a data dump of the sql as the host are using an out dated version 
       - please add a field called "change-yn" to the user table
         this will allow marc to download the users who have changed their phone numbers or addressesso he can update the local table.

		-I have finished the generation of unique references for public requests. Had some issues with active records but that has been solved.
		-The next step is to add functionality to Valdeck's public request form. I dont think we need all of those fields on the form though.eg public_requestid
