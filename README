Alright guys, This is the git repository we're gonna use for the project.
It may be better if we append all out programming update notes to this readme file.

Updates:

18/03/2012
  - Created a test.php in the root directory to test the database connection. It turns out the server is using
    a deprecated version of MySQL (version 4.1 - Oracle has stoped supporting it from 09.)
    The modern version of php in incompatible with it. 
    I recommend updated the mysql server before we proceed.
